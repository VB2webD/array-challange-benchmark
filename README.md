# Array Challenge Benchmark

This repository presents a fun and intriguing challenge: create a script that generates a matrix of specified dimensions (X × Y), filled with random integers. A deceptively simple task, but full of opportunities to explore optimization and creative problem-solving!

## The Challenge 🎯

Write a script that:
1. Accepts two integers, `X` (rows) and `Y` (columns), as input.
2. Returns an X × Y matrix filled with random integers.

## Why This Challenge? 🤔

I found this challenge both enjoyable and thought-provoking. It prompted me to dig deeper into topics like:
- Efficient memory usage
- Handling edge cases (e.g., negative integers)
- Balancing computational efficiency with simplicity

I enjoyed it so much that I even created a presentation to share the insights I gained along the way!

## Tips & Traps to Watch Out For ⚠️

Here are a few hints to help you tackle this challenge successfully:

1. **Negative Integers**: Don’t assume all integers are positive—your script should handle negative values gracefully.
2. **Operation Efficiency**: Generating large matrices? Consider the computational cost and avoid unnecessary loops or operations.
3. **Memory Management**: Large matrices can eat up memory quickly. Think about how you store and manipulate your data.
